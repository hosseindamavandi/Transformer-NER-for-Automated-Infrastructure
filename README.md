# [[ICWR 2025]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11006240) Transformer-Based Named Entity Recognition for Automated Server Provisioning
_Hossein Damavandi, Hasan Jalali, & Boshra Pishgoo_

ðŸš€ Official implementation for **Transformer-Based Named Entity Recognition for Automated Server Provisioning**.

This repository demonstrates a framework that bridges **voice commands** to **server configurations** using advanced transformer models. The approach extracts and processes key entities required for provisioning automated, scalable, and intelligent infrastructure solutions.
