# [ICWR 2025] Transformer-Based Named Entity Recognition for Automated Server Provisioning
Hossein Damavandi, Hasan Jalali, & Boshra Pishgoo

Official implementation for **Transformer-Based Named Entity Recognition for Automated Server Provisioning**.

This repository demonstrates a framework that bridges **voice commands** to **server configurations** using advanced transformer models. The approach extracts and processes key entities required for provisioning automated, scalable, and intelligent infrastructure solutions.

For more details, refer to the paper, [[Paper]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11006240).
